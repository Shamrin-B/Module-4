# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
import math

class cse:
    def mech(self, radius):
        area = math.pi * radius ** 2
        return area

try:
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
    if radius < 0:
        print("Radius cannot be negative.")
    else:
        obj = cse()
        result = obj.mech(radius)
        print(f"Area of the circle with radius {radius} is {result:.2f}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")
```
## Output
```
Enter the radius of the circle: 5
Area of the circle with radius 5.0 is 78.54
```
## Result
Thus, we have  written  a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.
